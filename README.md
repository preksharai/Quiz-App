# Quiz-App

This is a multiple activites application where in the first activity the user enter the name, age and city.
The second activity displays the quiz questions and user has the select one of the options. If he chooses right,
the color of the option turns to green otherwise red. User can go to next question through submit or skip button.
The last activity display the user name along with the score.
Here I have learnt how to link multiple activites through intent and how to transfer data among the activites.
